# NCache-Samples

NCache is a 100% .NET/.NET Core in-memory distributed cache & datastore. NCache provides an extremely fast and linearly scalable distributed cache that caches application data and reduces expensive database trips. 

This repository contains source code samples for **NCache Enterprise** that explain how to use NCache features. Each sample contains a *Readme.md* file that has instructions and pre-requisites to run that sample. 

The samples for modern NCache API are provided for the following supported environments:

- .NET Framework
- .NET Core
- Java
- Node.Js

For legacy API, the samples have been provided for:

- .NET Framework
- .NET Core
