This sample program demonstrates the usage of Events APIs.
  

CONVENTIONS
===========
For Linux  : $NCHOME refers to installation path where NCache is 
             installed.        

For Windows: %NCHOME% refers to the installation path where NCache is 
             installed.

             
PREREQUISITES
=============
This sample program requires     

    - NCHOME environment variable must be set. NCHOME refers to installation 
      path where NCache is installed. 

      To set NCHOME For Linux: 

        - Open shell.
		- Type "export NCHOME=/opt/ncache" without quotes and press ENTER key. 
          Replace /opt/ncache with the actual installation path if you have 
          installed NCache on non-default location. 


      To set NCHOME For Windows: 
        - Open Command Prompt.
        - type 'set NCHOME="C:\Program Files\NCache\"' without quotes 
          and press enter. 

    - jdk1.6 or higher
    - Netbeans v6 or later if you are using NetBeans to build and 
      run the project.
	  
However any other preffered method can NCache to compile the source 
located at $NCHOME/samples/java/Events/src/


HOW TO CONFIGURE
=================
This sample program NCache local cache "mycache" for operations. 

Local cache "mycache" can be started via:

     - startcache tool.
     - startcache tool located at $NCHOME/bin/startcache.sh (linux)
     - startcache tool located at %NCHOME%/bin/tools/startcache.exe (windows)

         OR

    - NCache Web Manager currently shipped only for Windows.

This sample program requires the event notifications to be turned on
for local "mycache".
    On Linux: Event notifications can be turned on/off by modifying the 
    cache config file. Add 
    <cache-notifications item-remove="true" 
        item-add="true" 
        item-update="true" 
    cache-clear="true"/> to cache-settings section of local "mycache".
   
    On Windows: Open NCache Web Manager.
	- From the left panel, select the "Local Caches" tab.
    - Click on View Details of "mycache" from the list.
    - Goto the options tab.
    - Check all event notifications in Notifications group.
    - Save changes.     


HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN
=======================
Make sure JAVA_HOME environment path variable is set. 

To Compile and Run via NetBeans:

    - Open Netbeans IDE.
    - Select File->Open Project
    - Locate $NCHOME/samples/java/Events
    - Add all .jar files to project libraries located at:
           - $NCHOME/java/lib
           - $NCHOME/java/lib/resources
    - Choose Run -> Clean and Build Project (Shift-F11) 
    - Press F6 to run the Project and observe output in NetBeans Output window.
  
         OR

To Compile and Run via Ant:

    - Make sure $ANT_HOME environment path variable is set.
    - Start shell (terminal/cmd)
    - Change directory to $NCHOME/samples/java/Events
    - Type 'ant' (without quotes)
    - This will compile the source and will place events.jar 
       at $NCHOME/samples/java/Events/dist/
    - Change directory to $NCHOME/samples/java/Events/dist/
    - NCache 'java -jar events.jar' without quotes to run the program.
