========================================================================
      NCache Continuous Query Sample Program Version 1.0      
========================================================================

PURPOSE OF THIS SAMPLE 
=======================  
This sample program demonstrates the usage of Continuous Query APIs.
  

CONVENTIONS
===========
For Linux  : $NCHOME refers to installation path where NCache is 
             installed.        

For Windows: %NCHOME% refers to the installation path where NCache is 
             installed.

             
PREREQUISITES
=============
This sample program requires     

    - NCHOME environment variable must be set. NCHOME refers to installation 
      path where NCache is installed. 

      To set NCHOME For Linux: 

        - Open shell.
		- Type "export NCHOME=/opt/ncache" without quotes and press ENTER key. 
          Replace /opt/ncache with the actual installation path if you have 
          installed NCache on non-default location. 


      To set NCHOME For Windows: 
        - Open Command Prompt.
        - type 'set NCHOME="C:\Program Files\NCache\"' without quotes 
          and press enter. 

    - jdk1.6 or higher
	- jre1.8 or higher is required to configure query indexes
    - Netbeans v6 or later if you are using NetBeans to build and 
      run the project.
However any other preffered method can NCache to compile the source 
located at $NCHOME/samples/java/ContinuousQuery/src/


HOW TO CONFIGURE
=================
This sample program NCache local cache "mycache" for operations. 

Local cache "mycache" can be started via:

     - startcache tool.
     - startcache tool located at $NCHOME/bin/startcache.sh (linux)
     - startcache tool located at %NCHOME%/bin/tools/startcache.exe (windows)

         OR

    - NCache Web Manager currently shipped only for Windows.


This sample program requires query indexes to be defined as follows:
  
    For Linux: NCache addqueryindex tool located at $NCHOME/bin/tools/
    addqueryindex: It will take:
    - cache id: "mycache" for this sample
    - assembly path: $NCHOME/samples/java/ContinuousQuery/dist/continuousquery.jar
    - class name: com.alachisoft.ncache.samples.data.Product for this sample
    - class attributes: _id, _name, _class, _category for this sample
    - dependant assembly folder: path of any other assemblies ncache by 
        continuousquery.jar - none for this sample
  
    For Windows: NCache Web Manager->View Details->Advanced Settings->Query Indexes Tab. 
    - Click Add->Browser->Locate continuousquery.jar at:
       %NCHOME%/samples/java/ContinuousQuery/dist/continuousquery.jar
    - Under Browsed Assemblies select com.alachisoft.ncache.samples.data.Product
    - Click Add Selected Classes->Select all attributes under Added Classes
    - Press OK


HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN
=======================
Make sure JAVA_HOME environment path variable is set. 

To Compile and Run via NetBeans:

    - Open Netbeans IDE.
    - Select File->Open Project
    - Locate $NCHOME/samples/java/ContinuousQuery
    - Add all .jar files to project libraries located at:
           - $NCHOME/java/lib
           - $NCHOME/java/lib/resources
    - Choose Run -> Clean and Build Project (Shift-F11) 
    - Press F6 to run the Project and observe output in NetBeans Output window.
  
         OR

To Compile and Run via Ant:

    - Make sure $ANT_HOME environment path variable is set.
    - Start shell (terminal/cmd)
    - Change directory to $NCHOME/samples/java/ContinuousQuery
    - Type 'ant' (without quotes)
    - This will compile the source and will place continuousquery.jar 
       at $NCHOME/samples/java/ContinuousQuery/dist/
    - Change directory to $NCHOME/samples/java/ContinuousQuery/dist/
    - NCache 'java -jar continuousquery.jar' without quotes to run the program.
