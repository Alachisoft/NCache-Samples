========================================================================
      NCache JCache Sample Program Version 1.0
========================================================================

PURPOSE OF THIS SAMPLE 
=======================  
This sample program demonstrates the usage of JCache APIs.

PREREQUISITES
=============
Before the sample application is executed make sure that:
    config.properties have been changed according to the configurations.
        Change the cache name
    By default this sample uses 'demoCache', make sure that cache is running.


HOW TO CONFIGURE
=================
There are 3 ways to load NCacheCachingProvider
	1 - The META-INF/services/javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider service definition that is located in the ncache-client maven
	package assures that applications using the javax.cache.Caching bootstrap class use the Coherence JCache provider by default.

	2 - The second way is to use the Caching.getCachingProvider(String) or Caching.getCachingProvider(String, ClassLoader)
	methods to explicitly request the Coherence JCache provider implementation.  

	3 - Third way is to override the default cache provider using the javax.cache.spi.cachingprovider system property 
	and specifying the fully qualified name of the JCache provider implementation class. 

	NOTE : Service definition is located in the ncache-client maven package so that user can use ncache-provider without configuring it.
