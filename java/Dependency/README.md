### Introduction

- This sample explains how NCache supports dependent items to be added, and what is the behaviour if dependency has a change.
- Sample adds one item dependent upon a file, key and database. 
- Any modification in the file, key or database will result in the invalidation of the item and thus the item will be removed from the cache.
- This sample deals with the File key and database dependency feature of NCache.
