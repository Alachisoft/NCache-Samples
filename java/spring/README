            NCache Spring Sample Program Version 1.0			
=============================================================================

PURPOSE OF THIS SAMPLE 
=======================  
This sample program demonstrates the usage of NCache with Spring framework.


CONVENTIONS
===========
For Linux  : $NCHOME refers to installation path where NCache is 
             installed.        

For Windows: %NCHOME% refers to the installation path where NCache is 
             installed.

             
PREREQUISITES
=============
This sample program requires     

    - NCHOME environment variable must be set. NCHOME refers to installation 
      path where NCache is installed. 

      To set NCHOME For Linux: 

        - Open shell.
		- Type "export NCHOME=/opt/ncache" without quotes and press ENTER key. 
          Replace /opt/ncache with the actual installation path if you have 
          installed NCache on non-default location. 


      To set NCHOME For Windows: 
        - Open Command Prompt.
        - type 'set NCHOME="C:\Program Files\NCache\"' without quotes 
          and press enter. 

    - jdk1.6 or higher
    - Netbeans v6 or later if you are using NetBeans to build and 
      run the project.

However any other preferred method can used to compile the source 
located at $NCHOME/java.com.alachisoft.ncache.samples/hibernate/src/


Application Configuration
=========================
By default this sample application use 'mycache' to store the session data. 

So make sure that:

	- cache 'mycache' exist in the 'client.conf' located at
	  '$NCHOME/config/' with correct server ip address and this 
	  cache should be started.


	- Include all the libraries located at :
	  -$NCHOME/lib
      -$NCHOME/lib/resources/
      -$NCHOME/lib/integrations/tg-spring.jar


Build Application
=================

To Compile and run via NetBeans:

	- Open the project at the following location '$NCHOME/java.com.alachisoft.ncache.samples/spring'
      in the NetBeans environment. 
	  
	- Make sure that project references all the libraries located at 
     '$NCHOME/lib' and '$NCHOME/lib/resources/'
	 
	- Make sure the project references spring framework libraries.
	
	- Add the �log4j.Properties� file as described in the Application Configuration 
      section in the default source package of the project.
	  
	- Define correct property of 'configFile' in 'ncacheConfigManager' bean in applicationContext.xml located at '$NCHOME/java.com.alachisoft.ncache.samples/spring/web/WEB-INF'.
	
	- Define correct property of 'configFile' in 'ncacheConfigManager' bean in applicationContext.xml located at '$NCHOME/java.com.alachisoft.ncache.samples/spring/web/WEB-INF'.
	
	- Copy ncache-spring.xml located at '$NCHOME/java.com.alachisoft.ncache.samples/spring' to '$NCHOME/config'
	  
	- Build the project, it will generate CustomerDBSpring.war in '$NCHOME/java.com.alachisoft.ncache.samples/spring/netbeans/dist'
