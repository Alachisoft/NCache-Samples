- jdk 11 or higher is required.
- NCache Java client installed on the machine.   
- This sample requires sample data project. Build SampleData project and install its mvn package using the following commands:
    - Open command prompt.
    - cd to the SampleData directory.
    - run: 
        ``` mvn clean package ```
