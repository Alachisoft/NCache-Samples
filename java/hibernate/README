=============================================================================
            NCache Hibernate Sample Program Version 1.0			
=============================================================================

PURPOSE OF THIS SAMPLE 
=======================  
This sample program demonstrates the usage of NCache with Hibernate framework.


CONVENTIONS
===========
For Linux  : $NCHOME refers to installation path where NCache is 
             installed.        

For Windows: %NCHOME% refers to the installation path where NCache is 
             installed.

             
PREREQUISITES
=============
This sample program requires     

    - NCHOME environment variable must be set. NCHOME refers to installation 
      path where NCache is installed. 

      To set NCHOME For Linux: 

        - Open shell.
		- Type "export NCHOME=/opt/ncache" without quotes and press ENTER key. 
          Replace /opt/ncache with the actual installation path if you have 
          installed NCache on non-default location. 


      To set NCHOME For Windows: 
        - Open Command Prompt.
        - type 'set NCHOME="C:\Program Files\NCache\"' without quotes 
          and press enter. 

    - jdk1.6 or higher
    - Netbeans v6 or later if you are using NetBeans to build and 
      run the project.

However any other preferred method can used to compile the source 
located at $NCHOME/samples/java/hibernate/src/


Application Configuration
=========================
By default this sample application use 'mycache' to store the session data. 

So make sure that:

	- cache 'mycache' exist in the 'client.conf' located at
	  '$NCHOME/config/' with correct server ip address and this 
	  cache should be started.


	- Include all the libraries located at :
	  -$NCHOME/java/lib
      -$NCHOME/java/lib/resources/
      -$NCHOME/java/lib/integrations/nc-hibernate.jar

	- HibernateSample named database should exist in MySQL. Use Sql Scripts located
      at '$NCHOME/samples/java/hibernate/mysql-scripts' to create hibernatesample database
      in Linux and Windows.


Build Application
=================

To Compile and run via NetBeans:

	- Open the project at the following location '$NCHOME/samples/java/hibernate'
      in the NetBeans environment. 
	  
	- Make sure that project references all the libraries located at 
     '$NCHOME/java/lib', '$NCHOME/java/lib/resources/' and 
	 '$NCHOME/java/lib/integrations/nc-hibernate.jar'
	 
	- Make sure the project references hibernate framework libraries.
	
	- Add the ‘log4j.Properties’ file as described in the Application Configuration 
      section in the default source package of the project.
	  
	- Define correct property of hibernate.connection.url in hibernate.cfg.xml.
	
	- Provide correct information in properties of hibernate.connection.username and hibernate.connection.password.
	
	- Copy NCacheHibernate.xml located at '$NCHOME/samples/java/hibernate' to '$NCHOME/config'
	  
	- Build the project, it will generate hibernate.jar in '$NCHOME/samples/java/hibernate/dist'
	
		OR
	
To Compile and run via Ant:

	- Make sure $ANT_HOME environment path variable is set.
	
    - Start shell (terminal/cmd)
	
    - Change directory to $NCHOME/samples/java/hibernate
	
	- Modify build.xml file located at $NCHOME/samples/java/hibernate/ as follows:
    
    - Change value of "hibernate" property to the path where hibernate framework libraries exist.

	- Goto $NCHOME/samples/java/hibernate/$ in shell(linux) / dos(windows).

	- Run ant

	- This will compile hibernate src and will place hibernate.jar in $NCHOME/samples/java/hibernate/dist.
