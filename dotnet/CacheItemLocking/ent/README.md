## Introduction

This sample is a .NET 8.0 console application which demonstrates NCache's pessimistic cache item locking feature. This is a locking mechanism to prevent concurrent modifications and preserve data consistency in a distributed cache. Using demo `Customer` objects, it shows thread-safe read‑modify‑write patterns and both implicit ([GET with acquireLock](https://www.alachisoft.com/resources/docs/ncache/prog-guide/locking-cache-items.html#acquiring-a-lock-during-data-retrieval-get-operations)) and explicit ([Lock](https://www.alachisoft.com/resources/docs/ncache/dotnet-api-ref/Alachisoft.NCache.Client.ICache.Lock.html) / [Unlock](https://www.alachisoft.com/resources/docs/ncache/dotnet-api-ref/Alachisoft.NCache.Client.ICache.Unlock.html)) lock management, along with a simple add/remove lifecycle for the cached item.

This sample references the `SampleData` project, which contains the `Customer` model used throughout the sample.

## Prerequisites

Before running the sample, ensure that:

- .NET 8.0 SDK and Visual Studio (recommended) are installed.
- NCache is installed and running in an accessible location.
  - If not, visit the following link to get started:\
  https://www.alachisoft.com/resources/docs/ncache/getting-started/
- Ensure that `demoCache` (or another cache of your choice) is running.
  - This is created during installation, otherwise you can create a new cache via this link:\
  https://www.alachisoft.com/resources/docs/ncache/admin-guide/create-new-distributed-cache.html
- NuGet package required: **Alachisoft.NCache.SDK (>= 5.3.6.1)**. The package reference is already included in the project file.
- SampleData project (which contains the `Customer` model) must be present in the directory as this sample.

## Build and Run the Sample

Before building this sample, if you need to change the cache name, open `App.config` from the project root directory and change the `CacheName` value:

```xml
<appSettings>
  <add key="CacheName" value="demoCache"/>
</appSettings>
```

From Visual Studio (Recommended):
- Open `CacheItemLocking.sln`.
- Let NuGet packages restore.
- Build and run.

From command line (optional):
```bash
# Replace <path-to-sample> with the sample location on your machine,
# e.g. d:\ncache-samples\CacheItemLocking
cd "<path-to-sample>"
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

- Ensure the sample solution references SampleData before building:
   - **Visual Studio**: Right-click the solution → Add → Existing Project → `SampleData\SampleData\SampleData.csproj`
   - **Command line**: Add the project reference or edit the solution file to include the SampleData project.

### NuGet Packages Are Not Restored

- If NuGet packages are not restored properly:
	- **Visual Studio**: Right‑click the solution → Restore NuGet Packages.
	- **Command line**: Run `dotnet restore` in the sample folder (see [Build and Run](#build-and-run-the-sample) section).
	- **nuget.exe**: Run `nuget restore CacheItemLocking.sln`.

### Cannot Connect to Cache

- Verify the NCache service is running.
- Verify that the configured cache (for example, `demoCache`) exists and is running.
- Verify that the cache name in `App.config` matches the running cache.
- Verify that [firewall rules](https://www.alachisoft.com/resources/docs/ncache/install-guide/firewalls-ports.html) allow communication with the cache server.
