## Introduction

This .NET 8.0 console sample demonstrates the NCache Distributed Counter data structure. A Distributed Counter is a cluster‑wide, atomic numeric counter you can increment, decrement, read and reset from any client — operations are performed atomically across the cache cluster. 

The sample shows how to create or retrieve a counter from the cache, perform Increment/Decrement operations (atomic and value) and remove the counter.

## Prerequisites

Before the sample application is executed, make sure that:

- .NET 8.0 SDK or Visual Studio (recommended) installed.
- NCache is installed and running in an accessible location.
  - If not, visit the following link to get started:\
  https://www.alachisoft.com/resources/docs/ncache/getting-started/ncache.html
- Ensure that `demoCache` (or another cache of your choice) is running.
  - This is created during installation, otherwise you can create a new cache via this link:\
  https://www.alachisoft.com/resources/docs/ncache/admin-guide/create-cache.html/
- NuGet package required: Alachisoft.NCache.SDK (>= 5.3.6.1). The package reference is already included in the project file.

## Build and Run the Sample

Before building this sample, if you need to change the cache name, open `App.config` from the project root directory and change the `CacheName` value:

```xml
<appSettings>
  <add key="CacheName" value="demoCache"/>
</appSettings>
```

From Visual Studio (Recommended):
- Open `DistributedCounter.sln`.
- Let NuGet packages restore.
- Build and run.

From command line (optional):
```bash
# Replace <path-to-sample> with the sample location on your machine,
# e.g. d:\ncache-samples\DataStructures\DistributedCounter
cd "<path-to-sample>"
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## Notes

- If NuGet packages are not restored properly:
	- Visual Studio: Right‑click the solution → Restore NuGet Packages.
	- Command line: run `dotnet restore` in the sample folder (see Build and Run section).
	- If using nuget.exe: run `nuget restore DistributedCounter.sln`.
